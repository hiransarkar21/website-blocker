# website-blocker

a pyqt5 software to help focus more on studies and programming and reduce the amount of time i spent on social media apps. this software is created in such a way that there is a very little window to exploit its functions and features.
even for me ( the developer ) it should be hard to exploit.

## how the software works

the software allows you to add websites that you want to be blacklisted and schedule custom session. for a fast session the software has options for a default session where the user can mention all the common social media apps that he wants blacklisted when setting up the software. And choose default session option when activating the the software's track and block sequence.
once the track and block sequence is initialized, the software starts an inbuilt django server and the extension acesses the APIs that holds informations about the the websites that needs to be blocked and when the session ends etc, and acts according to the
those informations.

## technologies and packages i used

- django (for api developement)
- logging (debugging)

## technologies i will have learnt after completing this project

- API development
- better debugging and logging
- Working with databases

more information about the software, the extension and the django server coming up soon as i keep developing the software ....
